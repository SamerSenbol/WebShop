# WebShop to furniture Market

There was a furniture shop in Sweden who decides to start integration
between the real shop (face to face) with e-commerce (selling online).

So I was the person who chose to do that for them. 
I studied e-commerce web development for two years in Medieinstitutet in Gothenburg, 
so I used the knowledge and the experience which I get it from my studies in this project
which will serve the furniture shop that is going to start selling on net.

I hope to start soon on the testing steps and start fixing all the problems
and weakness points in this project to be suitable and useful to serve them
in good way and give them affective product to get their satisfying in my
work.
